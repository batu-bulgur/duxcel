# Roadmap

Continue product correctness, persistence internals and focused tests together. The native UI is the baseline; the former mock is retired. Native trackpad jitter/snap-back is implemented and user-confirmed on the current Mac. Reopen it only for a new reproduction. Browser workbook Open/Save and complete native/browser input coverage remain incomplete.

## Repository and C tooling

- [x] Remove executable mock, obsolete visual studies, duplicate document entry points and tracked historical screenshots/log payloads. Keep current requirements, real regression inputs, runtime assets/licenses and Git history.
- [x] Generate canonical and large analytical fixtures through C99/DuckDB instead of mock JavaScript/CLI chains.
- [x] Put executable/data/report outputs under `build/`; make clean semantics explicit and test ownership-safe cleanup.
- [x] Enforce role-based language/layout boundaries: C product-linked helpers, Python orchestration, JS browser adapters; tool/browser tests in explicit test subdirectories.
- [x] Separate reference data, dependency caches and stable locks from disposable build output; clean preserves data.
- [ ] Improve orchestration through its existing Python boundary with equivalent timeout, locking, failure/recovery and browser/platform coverage; no blanket language rewrite.
- [ ] Extract native scenarios from App into a test-only build boundary without losing assertions. Split cohesive App controllers only when directly needed.
- [x] Default incremental native App/review/helper builds to eight parallel compilation jobs, with one icon-generation owner and separate configuration/temp outputs. Keep mutable engine/desktop execution serialized.
- [ ] Extend compatible per-file compilation to legacy module-test builds, preserving renderer-stub/configuration boundaries before admitting their graph to parallel builds.
- [ ] Split the large browser integration driver by workflow behind one shared CDP/lifecycle layer; remove duplicated helpers instead of writing a second engine.

## Persistence and source identity

Shared C/native/official-Worker metadata slices already cover definitions, filters, cells/columns, IDs/counters, ledger/bindings and base format properties. These are partial reader components; tests remain essential.

- [ ] Complete format tags/selectors/scopes/memberships, combined ledger budgets and cross-owner validation.
- [ ] Finish historical migration, whole-candidate validation, atomic App publication and writer/output adapters. Enable real asynchronous browser Open/Save only after these pass.
- [ ] Finish external source relinking/handles and explicitly bounded source-content identity. Session registrations alone do not establish cross-session persistence or arbitrary SQL dependencies.
- [ ] Verify OPFS recovery, quota/failure/crash handling and portable workbook export; pin compatible Worker/extensions/hosting requirements.
- [ ] Complete source-record format lineage through custom queries/reindexing and unsupported multi-owner/Table/PIVOT histories. Preserve verified native subsets without overstating universal activation.

Use [browser persistence](design/BROWSER_PERSISTENCE.md) and [source-format identity](design/SOURCE_FORMAT_IDENTITY.md) for detailed contracts.

## UI, interaction and platform work

- [ ] Close remaining dropdown/menu/inspector focus, clipping, resize and narrow-window issues against current native requirements, with real or honestly disabled actions. Do not consult or recreate the retired mock.
- [ ] Verify browsing, same-sheet empty/existing pivots, contextual Fields/Rows/Columns/Values/Filters/Marks, charts, value/date filters, Steps/SQL/history, ribbon modes, short windows and 150% scale as a coherent native/browser state matrix.
- [ ] Finish intended shadow corners/exiting behavior; the opt-in corner diagnostic remains red. Decide intentional rendering changes explicitly rather than treating historical pixels as immutable design.
- [ ] Complete broader Unicode glyph coverage within measured CPU/GPU budgets. The current replacement glyph preserves text; CJK/emoji and larger atlas activation remain unresolved.
- [ ] Validate physical pinch/Space gestures, browser trackpad delivery, Safari, browser zoom/display changes, IME/focus, clipboard permissions, WebGL/context loss and accessible production semantics. These coverage gaps do not mean the accepted native pan fix is broken.
- [ ] Keep Linux/Windows boundaries portable; do not claim native OS validation that has not run. Standalone native distribution remains unfinished.

## Analytical work

- [ ] Extend Marks to fields beyond current result grain, bounded continuous color, persistent labels and multiple bindings.
- [ ] Implement typed manual cells/formulas and an explicit imported-data overlay model.
- [ ] Add further transforms/joins/table nesting and recovery features through narrow designs with actual DuckDB tests.

Retain native/Wasm review and the persistent agentic queue as development infrastructure, with strict production exclusion. Review helpers passing does not close a product feature. Use small isolated implementation lanes, concise source-scoped results and hidden desktop-owned tests; do not store repeated full evidence capsules in source control.
